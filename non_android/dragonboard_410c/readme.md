# DragonBoard 410 C
I have the binary setup and ready to go.

Before you run the miner, change the "mine.sh" script to reflect your
current pool, your username, & the number of threads you want to use.

# Pool I use
I am currently mining Electronium right now as it is more profitable to mine with a low powered device than Monero is (at the time of writing).

pool.etn.spacepools.org

For this pool you will need an Electronium wallet for the funds to be sent to.

This processor will timeout frequently if the difficulty is too high

# Expected Hashrate
* 4 Threads: ~13 H/S

If the unit gets too hot the hash rate will be diminished due to throttling
